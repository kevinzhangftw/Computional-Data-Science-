1. data['timestamp;']*fit.slope + fit.intercept give us the predicted rating given time. the scipy linear regression fuction takes in the timestamp as x variable and ratings as y varible to find a line of best fit. this line of best fit is stored in variable fit.slope and fit.intercept. 
2. the fit line is ploted from taking in the time data as numbers, multiply by slope and added intercept to get the predicted rating. The slope and intercept is calculated from the line of best fit, which says in our data, overtime, people tend to inflate their dog ratings. So you would expect higher ratings over time, as the data shows.Timestamps values are different representations of date time objects. Therefore it should match up to create_at because time is the input varible for the line of best fit
