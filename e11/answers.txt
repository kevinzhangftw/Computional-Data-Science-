1. In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

I cached the two results of the joined table after the two joine operations. If i did not use cache, the second time join, spark will have to redo all the work joining the first table again. 

2. How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?

running time without broadcasting
real  0m53.185s
user  0m24.436s
sys  0m1.296s

running time with broadcasting
real  0m53.734s
user  0m20.344s
sys  0m0.984s
