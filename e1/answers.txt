1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?

When I apply date_to_month function to every row of the data['date'], The function is applied similarly from numpy to pandas. I find numpy easier to work with and pandas is much more easier to use. Pandas has some special features that allows to manipulate the data in more of advanced way.

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
In pivot_months_pandas, the running result is 10 loops, best of 3: 23.9 ms per loop. In pivot_months_loops, the running result is 1 loop, best of 3: 773 ms per loop. Using pandas function is faster because pandas is implemented in c while the loops in pivot_months_loops are done in python.
