1. Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value? Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?

The residuals are close enough to normal to look at the OLS p-value. Because the model coefficient is so low, it is difficult to conclude that the ratings are increasing.

2. Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?

Yes. the Kalman filter now has more information to predict where the next temperture will be. It is better at filtering noise and capture true data.
