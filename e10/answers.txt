1.How long did your reddit_averages.py take with (1) the reddit-0 data set and effectively no work, (2) no schema specified and not caching, (3) with a schema but not caching, (4) with both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame?

(1) the reddit-0 data set and effectively no work: 21.59s
(2) no schema specified and not caching: 53.31s 
(3) with a schema but not caching: 48.81s 
(4) with both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame: 46.17s

2.Based on the above, does it look like most of the time taken to process the reddit-2 data set is in reading the files, or calculating the averages?

It seems like more time will taken to calculate averages for reddit-2

3. Where did you use .cache() in your wikipedia_popular.py? [Hint: the answer had better be “once”… but where?]

Seems like cache before join is performs better than cache after join
